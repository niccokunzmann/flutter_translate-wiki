We can now easily convert our localized JSON content into static localization keys with [flutter_translate_gen](https://github.com/jesway/flutter_translate_gen)

A fully working example [can be found here](https://github.com/jesway/flutter_translate/tree/master/example_static_keys).


## Configuration

First we need to add the following dependencies to pubspec.yaml:

```dart
dependencies:
  flutter_translate_annotations: ^1.0.0

dev_dependencies:
  flutter_translate_gen: ^1.2.0
  build_runner: ^1.7.0
```

Next step is updating the packages:

```dart
flutter pub get
```

In the root directory (where ``pubspec.yaml`` is located) we need to create a file called ``build.yaml``

Here we need to declare the path to the ``lib`` directory, as well the path to the assets directory, the one containing the localization files, default is ``assets/i18n/``

```dart
targets:
  $default:
    sources:
      include:
        - assets/i18n/**
        - lib/**
```
